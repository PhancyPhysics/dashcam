# DashCam Notes

We had to execute pip without the $PATH variable to get openCV to work with python3.

We also had to manually install packages required by openCV since installing through pip does not download dependencies

    ImportError: libjasper.so.1: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory

# Project history before creating github repo:

DashCam3 adds a cameraClass for more efficient use of camera but at the cost of breaking video recording.
DashCam2 adds Timelapse mode where image capture will be repeated for a set duration. Multithreading was also introduce to allow image capture even while the timelapse mode was enabled. 
DashCam1 adds bluetooth module that allows a device to connect to Raspberry Pi to capture an image on command.  
DashCam0 captures an image every 15 seconds on program startup.
